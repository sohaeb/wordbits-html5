WordBits
========

An HTML5 mobile game for Ubuntu Touch: put together bits of words to solve the clues!

Rather transparently inspired by 7 Little Words, of course. WordBits has all the definitions locally -- they're extracted from WordNet (Princeton University "About WordNet." WordNet. Princeton University. 2010. http://wordnet.princeton.edu)

Done using the Ubuntu Touch HTML5 theme, so the game appears like a native Ubuntu Touch app, but it's pure client-side HTML5.
